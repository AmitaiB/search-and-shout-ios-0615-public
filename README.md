# Search and Shout

## Instructions

  1. Check out what we have for you!
  2. When a user selects the search button, they are presented with all the
     fields they can search by.
  3. When a user selects the search button. You should search by the
     appropriate field, and **only show the field that was searched**. So if
     they pressed the step1 button only the step1 field for each `FISDanceMove`
     is shown.
